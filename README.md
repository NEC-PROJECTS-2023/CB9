**INTRODUCTION :**

In our present generations technology has been drastically improved. People always wants the 
easiest and simplest ways in their respective works. Regarding that, online chat applications has 
been drastically came into this category and created a huge impact on our lives. There is not even 
a single day where people don’t use these chat applications. One such application is WhatsApp. 
WhatsApp has started its impact since 2008. From then, the users and the usage of this application 
has been improving. As people are becoming dependent on these chat applications directly or 
indirectly, analyzing these data has become necessary.
People analyze the data for various purposes like parents or care takers who wants to guard the 
kids from unknown cyber threats, business people who wants to understand their customers needs, 
police who wants to retrieve the information from culprit’s chat etc. But, in order to analyze that 
vast data which has been increasing rapidly is very difficult.
WhatsApp chat Analysis is a web application which analyze the imported WhatsApp chat data 
through simple visuals and can able to identify the sentiment of the chat whether it is positive, 
negative or neutral. The sentiment analysis is done using the Vader sentiment analysis tool which 
exists in the natural language tool kit(nltk).
Finding the sentiment of the chat will also help in identifying the business relations of the 
customers with their reviews. Without sentiment analysis it would be difficult to identify the 
overall review of the product as we have to check each individual comment/data. By using this 
sentimental analysis mechanism we can find the over all review of the product in terms of positive, 
negative or neutral.

**DATASET**

There is no need of any external dataset. We can use our imported whatsapp chat data which must be in
text format as a dataset.
